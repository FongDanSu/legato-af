/** @page basicBuildLegato Install/Remove Legato via Command-Line

The following directions will guide you to set up your Linux development machine, download the
Legato AF and install a build on your Target Device using the command line.

@section buildPackages Install Linux Packages

@verbatim
$ sudo apt-get install bison build-essential chrpath cifs-utils cmake coreutils curl
                       desktop-file-utils diffstat docbook-utils doxygen fakeroot flex g++ gawk gcc
                       git-core gitk graphviz help2man libgmp3-dev libmpfr-dev libreadline6-dev
                       libsdl-dev libtool libxml2-dev libxml-libxml-perl make m4 ninja-build
                       python-pip python-jinja2 python-pysqlite2 quilt samba scons sed subversion
                       texi2html texinfo unzip wget libcurl4-gnutls-dev zlib1g-dev
@endverbatim

Optional packages: vim (or any text editor), zsh (command interpreter for shell scripting)

@section buildToolchain Install a Toolchain

If you are building the Legato AF for a SWI WP Series Device you will need to download and install a
Toolchain which includes GCC and other tools needed to make a build for your Target Device.  If you
are building Legato AF directly on a Raspberry Pi then no toolchain is needed and you only need to
install the native GCC.  If you are cross-compiling the Legato AF on a Linux machine for use on a
Raspberry Pi Device, then you will need to install Raspberry Pi's toolchain.

@subsection buildToolchainSWI SWI WP Series Device Toolchain

Sierra Wireless platforms
[download the toolchain.](http://source.sierrawireless.com/resources/legato/downloads/)

Once you've downloaded the SWI toolchain installer you may need to grant execute rights before it
can be run.
@verbatim
$ chmod +x <toolchain>
@endverbatim

Upon running the toolchain installer you will be prompted where you want to install the tools.

Enter: @verbatim /opt/swi/y17-ext-<legato version> @endverbatim

When prompted, answer "Y" to proceed with the install.

@verbatim
$ ./poky-swi-ext-glibc-x86_64-meta-toolchain-swi-ext-armv7a-vfp-neon-toolchain-swi-ext-1.7.3.sh
Enter target directory for SDK (default: /opt/swi/y17-ext): /opt/swi/y17-ext-1610
You are about to install the SDK to "/opt/swi/y17-ext-1610". Proceed[Y/n]?Y
Extracting SDK...done
Setting it up...done
SDK has been successfully set up and is ready to be used.
@endverbatim

Create a soft link from the versioned folder to /y17-ext (delete the existing soft link if needed)

@verbatim
$ cd /opt/swi
$ rm y-17-ext
$ ln -s y17-ext-1610 y17-ext
@endverbatim

@note Each version of Legato requires its own toolchain. To support multiple versions on one host:
-  create a folder for each version
-  update the softlink "/opt/swi/y17-ext" to point to the legato version that are currently working
   with.
To change versions update the soft link to point to the new Legato version you are working with.

@subsection buildRaspberryToolChain Raspberry Pi Toolchain

Raspberry Pi platforms (clone from the GitHub repo):
@verbatim
git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools
@endverbatim

Copy the @c /tools/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian directory to a shared
location on your Linux Development Host.

Add @c /tools/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian/bin to your $PATH
@verbatim
export PATH=$PATH:${PWD}/tools/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian/bin
@endverbatim

@note The 64bit Raspberry Pi toolchain is located:
@c /tools/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian-x64

@section buildDownload Download the Source Code

To start with building Legato you first need to download or clone the source.

@subsection buildTarball Download Tarball

Visit our @ref aboutReleaseInfo "Release Info" page to download the Legato AF.

Download the Tarball and extract it to a directory on your local machine
@verbatim
$ mkdir legato-demo
$ mv ~/Downloads/legato-16.10.1.tar.bz2 legato-demo/
$ cd legato-demo/
$ tar -xvf legato-16.10.1.tar.bz2
@endverbatim

@subsection buildClone Clone from GitHub

The [GitHub Legato Project](https://github.com/legatoproject/legato-af#clone-from-github)
provides all up-to-date code development as well as official releases.  To clone the latest official
release clone the last release tag (e.g., -m legato/releases/16.10.1.xml), and not the master branch.

See the @ref aboutReleaseInfo page to list the supported releases.

Install repo:

On Ubuntu >= 16.04

@verbatim
$ sudo apt-get install repo
@endverbatim

On <= 16.04

@verbatim
$ sudo apt-get install phablet-tools
@endverbatim

OR

@verbatim
$ wget -O ~/bin/repo https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo
$ chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
@endverbatim

Clone a specific release:

@verbatim
$ mkdir workspace
$ cd workspace
$ repo init -u git://github.com/legatoproject/manifest -m legato/releases/16.10.1.xml
$ repo sync
@endverbatim

Clone from master (latest in progress development):

@verbatim
