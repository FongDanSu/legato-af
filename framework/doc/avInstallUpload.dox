/** @page avInstallUpload Create and Install Bundles


Build and update system and App bundles and upload them to AirVantage to deploy on your target.

@section avInstall Create App or System Bundle

@subsection avInstallSys Create a System Bundle

System and App updates are uploaded to AirVantage as a special @c zip file containing the app binary
update pack and an XML manifest. @ref buildToolsmksys builds the system bundle, while
@ref buildToolsmkapp builds the application bundle.
To combine the xml and zip files into another @c zip for AirVantage delivery, use the
@ref toolsHost_av-pack tool.

Build a custom system called "custom" for deployment through AirVantage:
@verbatim
$ mksys -t wp85 custom.sdef
$ av-pack -u custom.wp85.update -b _build_custom/wp85 -t WP8548
@endverbatim

@note The @c -t must match the type set in the application model of your target. The default WP type
is "WP8548".

@ref buildToolsmksys builds the "custom" system for the @c wp85 target and outputs an @c .update
file and @c manifest.app (the xml manifest file needed to update your system with AirVantage).
The files are generated under the builds working directory (e.g., @c ./_build_custom/wp85).

@ref toolsHost_av-pack builds the @c .zip file that can be uploaded to AirVantage.

@subsection avInstallApp Create an App Bundle

Build an application for deployment through AirVantage:

@verbatim
$ mkapp -t wp85 helloWorld.adef
$ av-pack -u helloWorld.wp85.update -b _build_helloWorld/wp85 -t abcCo.jsmith.helloWorld
@endverbatim

@ref buildToolsmkapp builds the @c helloWorld app for the @c wp85 target. The update pack file
@c helloWorld.wp85.update and the AirVantage manifest file @c manifest.app are generated.

The @c manifest.app file is generated under the builds working directory (e.g.,
<c>./_build_helloWorld/wp85</c>).

@ref toolsHost_av-pack packs these two files together and sets the apps @b type to
<c>abcCo.jsmith.helloWorld</c>.

@subsection avInstallAppType Setting an App Type

The Apps type must be a globally-unique app type identifier, @b unique among @b all @b Apps in
@b all @b companies @b anywhere on AirVantage.

Best Practices in uniquely naming type identifiers:
    - Include a unique identifier for your company name to prevent naming conflicts with other
    companies in the world.
    - For developers Apps, include the developer's name to prevent conflicts with other developers
    in the same company.

@note If no type is specified the type defaults to: @c appName-legato-application.

The output for this sample is @c helloWorld.zip. and is located in the build root.

@subsection avInstallAppSigs App Signature Checks

If your target device has been configured for app signature checks or to accept only encrypted
apps, you must use your signing/encryption tool to sign the @c .update file and then
pack it with @c av-pack instead. Don't sign or encrypt the @c manifest.app file, or the final
@c .zip file, as AirVantage won't be able to read them.

@verbatim
$ mkapp -t wp85 helloWorld.adef
$ cat helloWorld.wp85.update | myAppSigner > helloWorld.wp85.signed
$ av-pack -f helloWorld.wp85.signed abcCo.jsmith.helloWorld _build_helloWorld/wp85
@endverbatim

@section avInstallUpload Uploading an App or System Bundle

@subsection avInstallUploadCreateInstJob Create App/System Installation job

Create the app/system install job on the platform:
    - In your system 'Monitor' view
    - "More" menu
    - App Install:
        -  Choose "Install Application" and select the zip file created in the previous step.
    - System Install:
        -  Choose "Install Bundle" and select the zip file created in the previous step.

@subsection avInstallUploadRcvAgent Receive App/System on AirVantage Agent

This requires an @c avc control app using the LWM2M AVC API that accepts the download and
installation. See @ref c_le_avc API for details.

@subsection avInstallUploadStatus Check Success Status

If the installation was successful, you should find @c helloWorld in the installed apps and
on the targets' "Monitor" view app list in the AirVantage UI.
